# Pets - Landing Page

As part of The Odin Project course, I've created a landing page about pets with calling to action for adopting one. On this webpage I've used all concepts I learned about HTML and CSS.

Also, as part of my previous knowledge I've created an improve webpage that it is required for this level. Implementing web responsive design, some interactivity with JavaScript (the menu mobile), and a clear and good programming code.

Furthermore, some og the images are upload on a cloud and get them by https protocol.
